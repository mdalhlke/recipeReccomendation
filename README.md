### What is Daily Bites?

Other nutrition apps require extensive data entry, focus on weight loss or caloric intake (which can actually hinder goals), and have limited functionality.

Daily Bites is a nutrition app that emphasizes eating a balanced diet rather than caloric intake. It features natural language processing in the chatbot to provide a nutritionist-like experience. Additionally, it includes recommended recipes tailored to each user's diet and preferences.

### This Repo

This repo provides the backend recipe reccomendation portion of Daily Bites. However instead of Python Flask, this version is coded Node.js.
